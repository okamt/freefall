# FREE FALL: Jam Version

Game made in five days for Minestom Game Jam 2024.

## Usage

Depends on version 0.0.1 of [the Mage library](https://github.com/okamt/mage). `git clone` the repo somewhere, `git checkout` to the 0.0.1 commit and `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`.

Set the `BUNGEE` environment variable if using BungeeCord proxy. Optionally set `OP` (players that can use debug commands in game) to a list of Minecraft usernames separated by `,`.

Then, just build and run the jar as usual. Server will start on `0.0.0.0:25565`.
